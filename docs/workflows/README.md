# Workflows

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered by the following events:

- **Push**: When code is pushed to specific branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
- **Pull Request**: When a pull request is created or updated.
- **Manual Trigger**: If configured, users can trigger the workflow manually from GitHub UI.
