BusyBox combines common UNIX utilities into a single containerization. It provides tools
for most of the utilities usually usable for works such terraform, terragrunt, awscli, database-client, and even runtime
for applications. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options to install as needed. BusyBox provides a fairly
complete environment for any small or embedded system.
